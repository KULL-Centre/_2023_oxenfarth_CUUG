# Scripts and data for
ref

```md_setup/``` contains scripts and files to build the starting structures, as well as everything that's needed to set up the simulations.

```analysis/``` contains scripts and notebooks to calculate the NMR observables from the NMR bundles and the simulations, and to cluster the new ensemble. It also contains a notebook to recreate all plots based on simulation data in the manuscript.

The final structure ensemble, based on the simulations and experimental data, is located under ```analysis/md_plus_exp_subsampled.pdb```.
